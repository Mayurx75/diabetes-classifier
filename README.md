# Diabetes Binary Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Diabetes Classifier** is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical data. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`diabetes-classifier.ipynb`) and utilizes various machine learning techniques for classification.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Predictions based on input medical parameters
- Model performance metrics visualization

## 📂 Files and Directories

- `diabetes-classifier.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook containing data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Documentation file.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies required to run the project.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-classifier.git
cd diabetes-classifier
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `diabetes-classifier.ipynb` and run the cells.

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on a diabetes dataset containing medical records. If you are using an external dataset, ensure it is available in the project directory.

## 🎯 Model Performance

The classifier is evaluated using various performance metrics, such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
